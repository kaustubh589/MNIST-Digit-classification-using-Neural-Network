# Description
MNIST Digit Classification using Neural Network is a machine learning project that involves training a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The goal is to develop a neural network model that can accurately classify and predict the digit represented in each image. The neural network is trained on a subset of the dataset, learning the patterns and features associated with different digits. Once trained, the model is evaluated on a separate set of images to assess its accuracy in recognizing new, unseen handwritten digits. This project is a common starting point for beginners in deep learning and serves as a foundational example for image classification tasks using neural networks.

# Features
MNIST Digit Classification using Neural Network involves training a model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project includes preprocessing the images, designing the neural network architecture, selecting activation functions and optimization algorithms, and training the model on the training dataset. The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set, and metrics such as accuracy are calculated. This project serves as a fundamental introduction to image classification using neural networks and is often used as a starting point for learning deep learning concepts.
